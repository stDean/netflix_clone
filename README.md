# Summary
A netflix clone built with React Js, styled with Styled components, Context API for global state management, Fuse library for live search, Firebase for user authentication and for storing of the movies and series. The is app is built based on the original netflix app although it doesn't have all the complex functionalities the original does. I used compound components (just a design pattern) to build my components, I have built the following pages within this application: sign in, sign up, browse & lastly the homepage.

## Technologies Used
* React (Context, Custom Hooks).
* Fuse.
* Styled Component.
* Firebase.
* React Router Dom.
